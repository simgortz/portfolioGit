            <p>These days I spend most of my spare time playing World of Warcraft Classic - A newly rereleased version of the greatest MMORPG of all time. As the original game is now about 15 years old, and the User Interface hasn't really had its design properly updated for monitors bigger thanâ€¦ I don't know, like 640x480 or something, I find it very, very helpful to utilize Interface Add-ons that allow me to hide/show, resize, reposition, reconfigure essentially everything I can possible think of. This makes for a fun and interesting learning experience that'll help me become a better designer - and, of course, a better player!</p>

        <p class="centerTextOnWhite">The main goal with my current UI is to hide everything that doesn't present me needed information, so I can have the clearest view possible of the world around my character. This means that using this UI requires you to have played this specific character with these specific key-bindings before, as they're all hidden away since I've memorized them, and no longer have no need for them to be showing. Keep in mind that when I'm designing this interface, it is for myself - I would've done a lot of things differently had that not been the case. Anyway, I've placed all combat related information centered below my character to keep it within my field of view no matter where I'm looking. Below you'll see a side-by-side comparison of the UI that I'm currently working on and the original. Oh, and a big thanks to the creators of the Add-ons ElvUI and WeakAuras for making tools that allow this sort of customization!</p>

            <p id="uiComparisonBottomLeft">This is a screenshot of the default UI. I'll admit that it's charming, and that I could've set it up a little nicer without the use of add-ons for a more fair comparison - but I'd rather use that time on perfecting my own UI!</p>

            <p id="uiComparisonBottomRight">Here you can see how my current work-in-progress UI looks. It's still lacking a little information and is, admittedly, quite plain-looking, but I do believe it gives a good idea about what I'm trying to accomplish with it</p>
